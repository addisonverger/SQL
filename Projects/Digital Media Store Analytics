--For this project, I used a dataset called chinook, which represents a digital media store and includes tables for artists, albums, media tracks, invoices, and customers.
--I used SQLite to query the database.

--1. Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US.

SELECT firstName || ' ' || lastName AS full_name, customerId, country
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE country <> 'USA';

--2. Show only the Customers from Brazil.

SELECT firstName || ' ' || lastName AS full_name, customerId, country
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE country = 'Brazil';

--3. Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.

SELECT c.firstName || ' ' || c.lastname AS full_name, i.invoiceId, DATE(i.invoiceDate), i.billingCountry
FROM chinook.invoices i
JOIN chinook.customers c
ON i.customerId = c.customerId
WHERE c.country = 'Brazil';

--4. Show the Employees who are Sales Agents.

SELECT *
FROM chinook.employees
WHERE title LIKE '%Sales%' 
AND title LIKE '%Agent%';

--5. Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.

SELECT DISTINCT billingCountry
FROM chinook.invoices;

--6. Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name.

SELECT i.invoiceId, e.firstName || ' ' || e.lastName AS sales_agent_full_name 
FROM chinook.customers c
JOIN chinook.invoices i
ON c.customerId = i.customerId 
JOIN chinook.employees e
ON c.supportRepId = e.employeeId
ORDER BY i.invoiceId;

--7. Show the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers.

SELECT i.total, c.firstName || ' ' || c.lastName AS customer_name, c.country, 
e.firstName || ' ' || e.lastName AS sales_agent_name
FROM chinook.customers c
JOIN chinook.invoices i
ON c.customerId = i.customerId 
JOIN chinook.employees e
ON c.supportRepId = e.employeeId;

--8. How many Invoices were there in 2009?

SELECT COUNT(invoiceId)
FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE invoiceDate LIKE '2009%';

--9. What are the total sales for 2009?

SELECT SUM(total)
FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE invoiceDate LIKE '2009%';

--10. Write a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line ID.

SELECT t.name, i.invoiceLineId 
FROM chinook.tracks t
JOIN chinook.invoice_items i
ON t.trackId = i.trackId;

--11. Write a query that includes the purchased track name AND artist name with each invoice line ID.

SELECT a.track_name, a.artist_name, i.invoiceLineId
FROM
	(SELECT t.trackID AS track_id, t.name AS track_name, art.name AS artist_name
	FROM chinook.albums alb
	JOIN chinook.tracks t
	ON alb.albumId = t.AlbumId
	JOIN chinook.artists art
	ON alb.artistId = art.artistId) a
JOIN chinook.invoice_items i
ON a.track_id = i.trackId;

--12. Provide a query that shows all the Tracks, and include the Album name, Media type, and Genre.

SELECT t.name AS track_name, a.title AS album_name, m.name AS media_type, g.name AS genre
FROM chinook.tracks t
JOIN chinook.albums a
ON t.albumId = a.AlbumId
JOIN chinook.media_types m
ON t.mediaTypeId = m.MediaTypeId
JOIN chinook.genres g
ON t.genreId = g.GenreId;

--13. Show the total sales made by each sales agent.

SELECT e.firstName || ' ' || e.lastName AS sales_agent_full_name, ROUND(SUM(i.total), 2) AS total_sales
FROM chinook.customers c
JOIN chinook.invoices i
ON c.customerId = i.customerId 
JOIN chinook.employees e
ON c.supportRepId = e.employeeId
WHERE e.title LIKE '%Sales%' 
AND e.title LIKE '%Agent%'
GROUP BY sales_agent_full_name
ORDER BY e.lastName;

--14. Which sales agent made the most dollars in sales in 2009?

SELECT e.firstName || ' ' || e.lastName AS sales_agent_full_name, ROUND(SUM(i.total), 2) AS total_sales
FROM chinook.customers c
JOIN chinook.invoices i
ON c.customerId = i.customerId 
JOIN chinook.employees e
ON c.supportRepId = e.employeeId
WHERE e.title LIKE '%Sales%' 
AND e.title LIKE '%Agent%'
AND i.invoiceDate LIKE '2009%'
GROUP BY sales_agent_full_name
ORDER BY total_sales DESC LIMIT 1;

--15. What is the percentage of tracks in the system by media type?

SELECT m.name AS media_type_name, 
ROUND(COUNT(*) * 100.0 / (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM chinook.tracks), 2) AS percentage_tracks
FROM chinook.tracks t
JOIN chinook.media_types m
ON t.MediaTypeId = m.MediaTypeId
GROUP BY m.name;

--16. What is the percentage of tracks in the system by genre?

SELECT g.name AS genre_name, 
ROUND(COUNT(*) * 100.0 / (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM chinook.tracks), 2) AS percentage_tracks
FROM chinook.tracks t
JOIN chinook.genres g
ON t.genreId = g.genreId
GROUP BY g.name;

--17. Using the table tracks, show all the track names, their genre, their length, and the average length in their respective genre. Order the result by genre.

WITH avg_length AS (
        SELECT  AVG(t.milliseconds) AS average_length,
                g.name
        FROM tracks t
        JOIN genres g
        ON t.genreId = g.genreId
        GROUP BY g.name)
         
SELECT  t.name,
        g.name AS genre,
        t.milliseconds,
        avgl.average_length
FROM tracks t
JOIN genres g
ON t.genreId = g.genreId
JOIN avg_length avgl
ON g.name = avgl.name
ORDER BY g.name;

--18. For each invoice, create a query that returns the invoice id, country of the customer, the invoice total, and the average invoice total per country.

SELECT i.invoiceId, c.country, i.total,
AVG(i.total) OVER (PARTITION BY c.country) AS avg_invoice_total_per_country
FROM chinook.customers c
JOIN chinook.invoices i
ON c.customerId = i.CustomerId;

--19. How much did each customer spend per genre?

SELECT c.customerId,
  c.lastName,
  c.firstName,
  g.name AS genre,
  SUM(ii.unitprice * ii.quantity) AS total_spent
FROM chinook.customers c
JOIN chinook.invoices i 
ON i.CUSTOMERID = c.CUSTOMERID
JOIN chinook.invoice_items ii 
ON ii.INVOICEID = I.INVOICEID
JOIN chinook.tracks t 
ON t.TRACKID = ii.TRACKID
JOIN chinook.genres g 
ON g.GENREID = g.GENREID
GROUP BY c.customerId, c.lastName, c.firstName, genre
ORDER BY c.customerId;

--20. What are the sales for The Office seasons per state for customers in the USA?

SELECT a.title, c.state, COUNT(t.trackid) AS total_sold
FROM chinook.albums a
JOIN chinook.tracks t
ON a.albumId = t.AlbumId
JOIN chinook.invoice_items ii
ON t.trackId = ii.trackId
JOIN chinook.invoices i
ON ii.invoiceId = i.invoiceid
JOIN chinook.customers c
ON i.customerId = c.customerId
WHERE a.title LIKE '%The Office%'
AND c.country = 'USA'
GROUP BY a.title, c.state;
