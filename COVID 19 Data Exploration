--Looking at Total Cases vs Total Deaths

SELECT location, date, total_cases, total_deaths, (total_deaths/total_cases) * 100 AS death_percentage
FROM PortfolioProject.CovidDeaths
ORDER BY 1, 2;

--Looking at Total Cases vs Population

SELECT location, date, total_cases, population, (total_cases/population) * 100 AS percent_population_infected
FROM PortfolioProject.CovidDeaths
ORDER BY 1, 2;

--Looking at Countries with the Highest Infection Rate compared to Population

SELECT location, population, MAX(total_cases) AS highest_infection_count, MAX((total_cases/population)) * 100 AS percent_population_infected
FROM PortfolioProject.CovidDeaths
GROUP BY location, population
ORDER BY 4 DESC;

--Showing Countries with the Highest Death Count per Population

SELECT location, MAX(CAST(total_deaths AS int)) AS total_death_count
FROM PortfolioProject.CovidDeaths
WHERE continent != ''
GROUP BY location
ORDER BY 2 DESC;

--Showing Continents with the Highest Death Count per Population

SELECT continent, MAX(CAST(total_deaths AS int)) AS total_death_count
FROM PortfolioProject.CovidDeaths
WHERE continent != ''
GROUP BY continent
ORDER BY 2 DESC;

--Looking at Global Total New Cases vs. Global Total New Deaths by Date

SELECT date, SUM(new_cases) AS total_new_cases, SUM(CAST(new_deaths AS int)) AS total_new_deaths, SUM(CAST(new_deaths AS int))/SUM(new_cases) * 100 AS death_percentage
FROM PortfolioProject.CovidDeaths
WHERE continent != ''
GROUP BY date
ORDER BY 1;

--Looking at Total Population vs. Vaccinations

WITH PopVsVac (continent, location, date, population, new_vaccinations, total_vaccinations) AS (
    SELECT dea.continent, dea.location, dea.date, dea.population, vac.new_vaccinations, 
    SUM(CAST(vac.new_vaccinations AS int)) OVER (PARTITION BY dea.location ORDER BY dea.location, dea.date) AS total_vaccinations 
    FROM CovidDeaths dea
    JOIN CovidVaccinations vac
    ON dea.location = vac.location
    AND dea.date = vac.date
    WHERE dea.continent != ''
)

SELECT *, (total_vaccinations/population) * 100 AS percentage_population_vaccinated
FROM PopVsVac
ORDER BY 2;

--Creating View to store data for later visualizations

CREATE VIEW TotalVaccinations AS
SELECT dea.continent, dea.location, dea.date, dea.population, vac.new_vaccinations, 
SUM(CAST(vac.new_vaccinations AS int)) OVER (PARTITION BY dea.location ORDER BY dea.location, dea.date) AS total_vaccinations 
FROM CovidDeaths dea
JOIN CovidVaccinations vac
ON dea.location = vac.location
