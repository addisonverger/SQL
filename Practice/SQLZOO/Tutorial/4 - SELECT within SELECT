--1. Bigger than Russia

SELECT name 
FROM world
WHERE population > (
  SELECT population FROM world
  WHERE name = 'Russia'
)

--2. Richer than UK

SELECT name
FROM world
WHERE continent = 'Europe'
AND GDP / population > (
  SELECT GDP / population
  FROM world
  WHERE name = 'United Kingdom'
)

--3. Neighbours of Argentina and Australia

SELECT name, continent
FROM world
WHERE continent IN (
  SELECT continent
  FROM world
  WHERE name = 'Argentina'
  OR name = 'Australia'
)
ORDER BY name ASC

--4. Between Canada and Poland (United Kingdom and Germany)

SELECT name, population
FROM world
WHERE population > (
  SELECT population
  FROM world
  WHERE name = 'United Kingdom'
) AND population < (
  SELECT population
  FROM world
  WHERE name = 'Germany'
)

--5. Percentages of Germany

SELECT name, CONCAT(CAST(ROUND(population * 100.0 / (SELECT population FROM world WHERE name = 'Germany'), 0) AS INT), '%') AS percentage
FROM world
WHERE continent = 'Europe'

--6. Bigger than every country in Europe

SELECT name
FROM world
WHERE GDP > (
  SELECT MAX(GDP)
  FROM world
  WHERE continent = 'Europe'
)

--7. Largest in each continent

SELECT continent, name, area 
FROM world x
WHERE area >= ALL(
  SELECT area 
  FROM world y
  WHERE y.continent = x.continent
  AND area > 0
)

--8. First country of each continent (alphabetically)

SELECT continent, name
FROM world a
WHERE name = (
  SELECT MIN(name)
  FROM world b
  WHERE b.continent = a.continent
)

--9. Find the continents where all countries have a population <= 25000000. Then find the names of the countries associated with these continents. Show name, continent and population.

SELECT name, continent, population 
FROM world x
WHERE 25000000 >= ALL(
  SELECT population 
  FROM world y
  WHERE x.continent = y.continent
  AND population > 0
)

--10. Some countries have populations more than three times that of all of their neighbours (in the same continent). Give the countries and continents.

SELECT name, continent
FROM world x 
WHERE population / 3 >= ALL(
  SELECT population
  FROM world y
  WHERE y.continent = x.continent
  AND x.name != y.name)
