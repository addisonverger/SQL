--1. Introducing the covid table

SELECT name, DAY(whn), confirmed, deaths, recovered
FROM covid
WHERE name = 'Spain'
AND MONTH(whn) = 3 
AND YEAR(whn) = 2020
ORDER BY whn

--2. Introducing the LAG function

SELECT name, DAY(whn), confirmed, LAG(confirmed, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY name ORDER BY whn)
FROM covid
WHERE name = 'Italy'
AND MONTH(whn) = 3 
AND YEAR(whn) = 2020
ORDER BY whn

--3. Number of new cases

SELECT name, DAY(whn), confirmed - LAG(confirmed, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY name ORDER BY whn)
FROM covid
WHERE name = 'Italy'
AND MONTH(whn) = 3 
AND YEAR(whn) = 2020
ORDER BY whn

--4. Weekly changes

SELECT name, DATE_FORMAT(whn,'%Y-%m-%d'), confirmed - LAG(confirmed, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY name ORDER BY whn) AS new_cases
FROM covid
WHERE name = 'Italy'
AND WEEKDAY(whn) = 0 
AND YEAR(whn) = 2020
ORDER BY whn

--5. LAG using a JOIN

SELECT tw.name, DATE_FORMAT(tw.whn,'%Y-%m-%d'), tw.confirmed - lw.confirmed AS new_cases
FROM covid tw 
LEFT JOIN covid lw 
ON DATE_ADD(lw.whn, INTERVAL 1 WEEK) = tw.whn
AND tw.name = lw.name
WHERE tw.name = 'Italy'
AND WEEKDAY(tw.whn) = 0
ORDER BY tw.whn

--6. RANK()

SELECT 
  name,
  confirmed,
  RANK() OVER (ORDER BY confirmed DESC) rc,
  deaths,
  RANK() OVER (ORDER BY deaths DESC) rd
FROM covid
WHERE whn = '2020-04-20'
ORDER BY confirmed DESC
