--(Easy) 1. Show the name and address of the keeper of vehicle SO 02 PSP.

SELECT k.name, k.address
FROM vehicle v
JOIN keeper k
ON v.keeper = k.id
WHERE v.id = 'SO 02 PSP'

--(Easy) 2. Show the number of cameras that take images for incoming vehicles.

SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM camera
WHERE perim = 'IN'

--(Easy) 3. List the image details taken by Camera 10 before 26 Feb 2007.

SELECT *
FROM image
WHERE camera = 10
AND DATE_FORMAT(whn, '%m-%d-%Y') < '02-26-2007'

--(Easy) 4. List the number of images taken by each camera. Your answer should show how many images have been taken by camera 1, camera 2 etc. The list must NOT include the images taken by camera 15, 16, 17, 18 and 19.

SELECT camera, COUNT(*) AS num_images
FROM image
WHERE camera NOT IN (15, 16, 17, 18, 19)
GROUP BY camera

--(Easy) 5. A number of vehicles have permits that start on 30th Jan 2007. List the name and address for each keeper in alphabetical order without duplication.

SELECT DISTINCT k.name, k.address
FROM keeper k
JOIN vehicle v
ON k.id = v.keeper
JOIN permit p
ON v.id = p.reg
WHERE DATE_FORMAT(p.sDate, '%m-%d-%Y') = '01-30-2007'
ORDER BY 1, 2

--(Medium) 6. List the owners (name and address) of Vehicles caught by camera 1 or 18 without duplication.

SELECT DISTINCT k.name, k.address
FROM keeper k
JOIN vehicle v
ON k.id = v.keeper
JOIN image i
ON v.id = i.reg
WHERE i.camera IN (1, 18)

--(Medium) 7. Show keepers (name and address) who have more than 5 vehicles.

SELECT k.name, k.address
FROM keeper k
JOIN vehicle v
ON k.id = v.keeper
GROUP BY 1, 2
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT v.id) > 5

--(Medium) 8. For each vehicle show the number of current permits (suppose today is the 1st of Feb 2007). The list should include the vehicle.s registration and the number of permits. Current permits can be determined based on charge types, e.g. for weekly permit you can use the date after 24 Jan 2007 and before 02 Feb 2007.

WITH CTE AS (
  SELECT reg, chargeType, DATE_FORMAT(sDate, '%Y-%m-%d') AS sDate, 
  DATE_FORMAT(
    CASE
      WHEN chargeType = 'Daily' THEN DATE_ADD(sDate, INTERVAL 1 DAY)
      WHEN chargeType = 'Weekly' THEN DATE_ADD(sDate, INTERVAL 1 WEEK)
      WHEN chargeType = 'Monthly' THEN DATE_ADD(sDate, INTERVAL 1 MONTH)
      WHEN chargeType = 'Annual' THEN DATE_ADD(sDate, INTERVAL 1 YEAR)
      ELSE ''
    END, '%Y-%m-%d') AS eDate
  FROM permit 
)

SELECT reg, COUNT(*) AS num_curr_permits
FROM CTE
WHERE sDate <= '2007-02-01' 
AND eDate > '2007-02-01'
GROUP BY 1
